## What is it?
-a simple tool to keep track of turn order in a dnd combat
-not a combat simulator
-not a compendium of info about dnd monsters
-used by DM not visible to players (unless you want?)


## screens required: 

 [ ] home screen:
    - new combat button (shows a modal to get the combat name, saves it and directs you to the combat screen)
    - save combat button (takes you to the combat screen)
    - fighters button (takes you to the fighters screen)

 [ ] Combat screen (the main point of the app): 
    - name the combat if there isn't one, if don't want to name it there should be a default
    - keep track of what round it is
    - keep track of the initiative order (each fighter has an initiative score, the list is sorted by score, the highest goes first, then the next...)
    - button to add a new fighter
    - list all currently added fighters
    - button to save this combat
    - next button to advance on turn (if it's the last fighter's turn, pressing "next" advances the round and it's the first fighter's turn)
    - states: pre-battle, during battle
    - when adding, it can be a player or a monster, or a group
     
 [ ] Info screen:
    - user should be able to click on a monster/fighter and pull up a stat block. 
    - maybe this is too extra though, only need data enough to track initiative.
 
 
 [ ] fighters screen:
    - button view prev saved groups
    - button to create a group
    - view list of all saved individual fighters
    - button to add a fighter for use later
    - manage/edit/delete fighters/groups
     
 
 [ ] create a group:
    - name the group
    - save the group
    - search saved individual fighters to add
    - add a new fighter to a group
    - remove a fighter from a group
    - delete the group and go back
    - make a "quick group" of 1-5 or custom
  
    


##Current Tasks:
   [ ] draw out each screen and make a flow chart of possible navigation/flow 
   [ ] get a minimal prototype running + test
   [ ] write tests if that's your thing
   [ ] remove all comments from project

##Completed Tasks:
   [x] remove "console.log(...)" statements in project
   [x] update "tabOptions" to "screenOptions" to get rid of warning
   [x]  install @react-navigation/native-stack
   [x] add stack navigation for when we want to navigate to a screen that doesn't have a tab such as when navigating to InfoView from SearchView
   [x] implement navigation to info screen using stack navigation existing MonsterStatsView component and it works!
##Extra features: 
    - roll random numbers for initiative to speed things up
    - a time tracker to keep track of how much time elapsed


##Bug Tracking:
   [ ] warning: "search" component within "search" component, how to properly nest stack nav inside tab nav?
